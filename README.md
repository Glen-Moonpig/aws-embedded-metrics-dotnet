Amazon CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format Client Library

EMF enables more efficient metrics writing by providing log buffering and flushing, and reduces cost of CloudWatch writes because, using EMF, you only pay for data volume, not API calls.

EMF also supports correlation of metrics with high cardinality properties (because they are co-located).
